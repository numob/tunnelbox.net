There is no background agent, no daemon installed on your machine, and no dependency on developer laptops staying online. It is designed for stability, long-lived services, and production use."},{question:"Do I need to configure my router or firewall?",answer:"No. Tunnelbox establishes an outbound secure tunnel, which works behind NAT, firewalls, and restrictive networks without any manual configuration."},{question:"Is TLS/SSL included?",answer:"Yes. All public endpoints are secured with TLS by default. Certificates are automatically managed for you."},{question:"Who is Tunnelbox for?",answer:"Tunnelbox is built for developers, hobbyists, startups, and professionals who need reliable external access to internal services without operational complexity."},{question:"Can I use Tunnelbox in production?",answer:"Yes. Tunnelbox is designed for long-running services and production workloads, not just temporary development tunnels."},{question:"What protocols are supported?",answer:"HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP-based services are supported.
